<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Coronary Stent Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bare-Metal Stents</li><li>Drug-Eluting Stents</li><li>Bioabsorbable Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The coronary stent devices market features three main types: bare-metal stents (BMS), drug-eluting stents (DES), and bioabsorbable stents. Bare-metal stents provide structural support in arteries but have a higher risk of restenosis. Drug-eluting stents are coated with medication that reduces scar tissue formation, improving long-term outcomes. Bioabsorbable stents are designed to dissolve over time, leaving no permanent implant, thus potentially minimizing long-term complications associated with traditional stents and offering innovative treatment options for patients.</p></p>
